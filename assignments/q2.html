    <!-- Q2. In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided dice. If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.
Can you reach your friend's tile number in the next roll? Create a function that takes your position a and your friend's position b and returns a boolean representation of whether it's possible to earn a bonus on any dice roll.
Examples
possibleBonus(3, 7) true
possibleBonus(1, 9) false
possibleBonus(5, 3) false
Note: -
You cannot move backward (which is why example #3 doesn't work).
If you are already on the same tile, return false, as you would be advancing away.
Expect only positive integer inputs. -->
